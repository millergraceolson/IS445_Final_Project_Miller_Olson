IS445- Data Visualization

Final Project, Spring 2024

Biggest Takeaway: Something that I really appreciated about this class was that we weren't just blindly analyzing data. Hence the name, we were able to create actual visualizations that helped me understand the data much better. In other classes that are teaching students about data, I feel as though they are often just working with large amounts of data with no real goal or outcome. In this class, we are exploring data through actually making graphs and visuals withthem, which is something that really helped me better understand data analytics.
